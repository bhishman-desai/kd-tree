# kdTree Implementation

## Project Overview

This project is a collection of classes that we've put together to perform a process which includes the following steps:

1. **Input**: Take the points or the coordinates as input and build a balanced kdTree or high dimension Binary Search Tree (BST) from those points.
2. **Functionality**: The kdTree would have the functionality of:
   - Searching for an element in the tree
   - Adding an element to the tree
   - Finding the points between specified minimum and maximum range
   - It would also have a property to know the length or the size of the tree (basically total number of nodes in the tree).
3. **Debugging**: The kdTree could also be printed for debugging purposes.

The goal is to build a data structure which would have the behavior and characteristics of a kdTree.
